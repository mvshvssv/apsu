# CLAUDE.md - Apsu

## Overview

<!-- Describe what this project is and what Claude does in it. -->

## Purpose

<!-- Describe the user's goal and Claude's role in reaching it. -->

## Workflow

### Response Style

Default to professional tightness. Drop filler words, pleasantries, hedging ("certainly", "great question", "I'll go ahead and"). Keep full sentences and articles. Technical terms, code blocks, IDs, error strings always verbatim. Expand to normal prose only for irreversible-action confirmations or multi-step sequences where compression risks misunderstanding.

## Skills

Match user's request to skill and invoke.

This table lists the model-invoked skills only. User-invoked skills are not listed — they fire only when the user types their name: `/handoff`, `/implement`, `/improve-codebase-architecture`, `/to-spec`, `/to-tickets`, `/triage`, `/writing-great-skills`.

### Agent Skills (Issue Tracking & Triage)

**Issue tracker** — GitHub Issues (`github.com/mvshvssv/apsu`), via `gh` CLI. External PRs are not a triage surface. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

**Triage labels** — Default label vocabulary: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

**Domain docs** — Single-context: `CONTEXT.md` at repo root, `docs/adr/` for past decisions. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
